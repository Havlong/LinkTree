# LinkCutTree

Light-Weight Link-Cut Tree implementation on Java language.

Implementation is based on [this repository](https://github.com/udovin/AlgoBook/blob/master/source/link_cut_tree.cpp)

You can find description of those functions [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/69879)

I read theoretical explanation [on this wiki](https://neerc.ifmo.ru/wiki/index.php?title=Link-Cut_Tree),
but [this](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/dynamic-trees.pdf) is original paper on Link-Cut Trees with Splay trees as a base

I hope this repository will help your needs
